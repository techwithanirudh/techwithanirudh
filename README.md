# My Bio
As a young tech enthusiast in the age range of 10-13, I have a long history with Lego, starting with a few Lego pieces that I used to build a minion when I was 4 years old. My passion for building and programming with Lego continued to grow with the gift of a Lego Classic kit from my dad, and the acquisition of a Lego Boost kit from my grandpa, which allowed me to program motors and sensors and build moving robots using block programming. I even started a YouTube channel called Anirudh's Toys Review to share my Lego creations.

I later discovered the Lego Mindstorms kit, which allowed me to build advanced robots and code with Python using EV3Dev. My foray into text-based programming and AI began with Python, and I have created over 100 projects using OpenCV, Tensorflow, GPT, and Azure AI. I am the world's youngest Microsoft Powerplatform and Azure AI certified individual, demonstrating my expertise in these areas. In addition to my technical skills, I have also learned how to build no-code/low-code apps and web apps, and have explored other technologies such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Linux.

I have had the opportunity to collaborate with Bosch, a leading global supplier of technology and services, on an AI-based autonomous car project. This project has allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge to a real-world challenge and make a meaningful impact. I have also written a research paper on face swapping for autonomous cars, which has allowed me to delve deep into the complex issues surrounding privacy and AI bias in autonomous vehicles.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to electronic music and sharing my creations on my personal website and social media platforms. I am active on Replit, Twitter, and LinkedIn, where I engage with other like-minded individuals and share my thoughts and ideas.
