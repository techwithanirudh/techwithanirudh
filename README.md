- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @techwithanirudh
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, HTML, JavaScript, ML, AI
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning How to make apps using electron.js

I'm a young tech enthusiast. It all started when I was a 4-year-old, I discovered few Lego pieces in my toy chest. I built a minion with it. Impressed by my creation, my dad gifted me a Lego Classic kit. I knew it was the beginning of a new adventure. I started building new Lego creations. When I was 5, my grandpa bought me a Lego Boost kit where I could program the motors and sensors and build moving robots using block programming. This was the beginning of the programming journey. I created new robots that were not in the Lego Boost app. I created a walking cat, walking and talking robot. I also started a YouTube channel called Anirudh's Toys Review to post my Lego creations. When I was 6, my uncle bought me a Lego Mindstorms Kit where you could build many advanced robots. I found out you can also code with python using Mindstorms using EV3Dev. Mindstorm's block programming language was not that powerful. So, I started learning python which was my foray into text-based programming. Day by day, I learned more. In six months, I fully learned python. I became very conversant in python I learned OpenCV, AI, TensorFlow. Till now python is my favorite language. I also learned HTML, JavaScript, CSS. I am very conversant at all of those too. I also dabbled with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Linux. I also created a YouTube channel called Tech With Anirudh to post my tech videos. That's how I learned to code.
