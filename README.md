# My Bio
As a young tech enthusiast in the age range of 10-13, I have a long history with Lego, starting with a few Lego pieces that I used to build a minion when I was 4 years old. My passion for building and programming with Lego continued to grow with the gift of a Lego Classic kit from my dad, and the acquisition of a Lego Boost kit from my grandpa, which allowed me to program motors and sensors and build moving robots using block programming. I even started a YouTube channel called Anirudh's Toys Review to share my Lego creations.

I later discovered the Lego Mindstorms kit, which allowed me to build advanced robots and code with Python using EV3Dev. My foray into text-based programming and AI began with Python, and I have created over 100 projects using OpenCV, Tensorflow, GPT, and Azure AI. I am the world's youngest Microsoft Powerplatform and Azure AI certified individual, demonstrating my expertise in these areas. In addition to my technical skills, I have also learned how to build no-code/low-code apps and web apps, and have explored other technologies such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Linux.

I have had the opportunity to collaborate with Bosch, a leading global supplier of technology and services, on a variety of AI and autonomous car projects. These projects have allowed me to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges and make a meaningful impact. I have written a research paper on face swapping for autonomous cars, which has allowed me to delve deep into the complex issues surrounding privacy and AI bias in autonomous vehicles, and consider the ethical implications of these technologies.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to electronic music from artists like Andrew Applepie. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including Material UI, JavaScript, Node JS, HTML5, TypeScript, Figma, Python, CSS3, Git, React, and Sass. I prefer using Windows as my operating system and maintain a personal website to share my creations and tech videos with others. I am active on social media platforms such as Replit, Twitter, and LinkedIn
