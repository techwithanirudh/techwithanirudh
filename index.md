# My Bio
I'm a  young tech enthusiast. It all started when I was a 4-year-old. I discovered few Lego pieces in my toy chest. I built a minion with it. Impressed by my creation, my dad gifted me a Lego Classic kit. I knew it was the beginning of a new adventure. I started building new Lego creations. When I was 5, my grandpa bought me a Lego Boost kit to program the motors and sensors and build moving robots using block programming. I created new robots that were not in the Lego Boost app. I made a walking cast, a walking and talking robot. I also started a YouTube channel called Anirudh's Toys Review to post my Lego creations. 

When I was 6, my uncle bought me a Lego Mindstorms Kit. I could build many advanced robots. I found out you can also code with python using Mindstorms using EV3Dev. 

Mindstorm's block programming language was not that powerful. So, I started learning python that was my foray into text-based programming and AI. I created multiple projects using OpenCV, Tensorflow, GPT and Azure AI.

I also learned to build  nocode/lowcode apps using Powerapps and web apps using HTML, JavaScript, CSS.  I also dabbled with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Linux. I have created a YouTube channel called Tech With Anirudh to post my tech videos.
